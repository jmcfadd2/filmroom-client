## Motivation

I wanted to create an app that can provide athletes access to the thought leaders in their sport from around the world and to their favorite coaches from around the corner 

## Inspiration
As an avid user of Strava, which tracks runs and Udemy, which provides online courses. I thought the combination of these two approaches could help those in team sports become better athletes and share their development while their at it.

### Training
![Training Demo](./src/images/Training_Demo.gif)
>In the Train tab users will be able to use drills learned in the [Courses](#courses) tab and track the amount of successful repetitions while doing them.


### Courses
![Courses Demo](./src/images/Courses_Demo.gif)
>In courses users find their desired course and add it to their library. Adding to the library allows user to watch the instrsutction videos and gives them access to the drills

## Road Ahead

Payment will give trainers the ability to monetize their content. This will be implemented through the Stripe Connect API

### Groups

The group functionality will provide Coaches to provide their teams with workouts and receive feedback on their players.
